Ubuntu issue with  python version which leads to error in terminator and terminal opening

this is because of the version mismatch between the apps and the default python version.

To fix the issue, try the following:

Correct a system with broken dependencies in place by:

sudo apt-get  -f install
Reconfigure all unpacked, but unconfigured packages by:

sudo dpkg --configure -a
If above won't help, try reinstalling python3-minimal package by:

sudo apt install -f --reinstall python3-minimal
Alternatively run:

apt-get download python3-minimal
sudo dpkg -i *python3*.deb
sudo apt install -f
Or download the .pkg file from kernel.org and install from the file by:

sudo dpkg -i python3-minimal_*.deb
Then make sure that py3compile and py3clean commands are runnable and are accessible from your PATH variable.
