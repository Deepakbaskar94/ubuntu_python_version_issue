root change password as root 

source: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28068155/access-denied-for-user-rootlocalhost-using-password-yes-after-new-instal

sudo mysql_secure_installation
press enter and assign a new password for root in mysql/mariadb.

If you get an error like

ERROR 2002 (HY000): Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock'

enable the service with

service mysql start
now if you re-enter with

mysql -u root -p
if you follow the problem enter with sudo su and mysql -u root -p now apply permissions to root

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '<password>';

this fixed my problem in MariaDB.
